# Blog_Post

•	Developed a web application that facilitates user registration, login, and blog posting, with features allowing users to edit, delete, and search for specific blogs using tags.
•	Utilized JavaScript, Express.js for server-side scripting, and Mongoose to create schemas, establishing routes to guide requests to controllers. These controllers execute functions such as registration, login, blog creation, editing, and commenting.
•	Employed MongoDB collections to store databases, with Mongoose serving as the connector to MongoDB. The user interface was crafted using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly system.
